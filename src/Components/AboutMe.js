      <p>
        My name is Tomi Horvat. I'm 25 years old and come from Maribor. I
        graduated on Faculty of Education as a kindergarten teacher.

        Already before finishing my diploma, I doubted that I made the right
        choice of my education. But I promised myself that I would try. When I
        finished working in the kindergarten, it was clear to me that I would
        rather work in some other field. I chose programming because I saw the
        current trend of "self-taught programmers" and wanted to give it a go.

        My inspiration was my older brother, who has been programming for more
        than 10 years. I challenged myself to learn the basics of front-end
        development and find a job in the IT world. I knew it wouldn't be easy,
        but I didn't want to give up. I chose JavaScript as my first programing
        language because I was mainly interested in front-end development. It is
        also a good start for beginners.

        I am currently studying for about 8 months. I went through courses on
        udemy, FreeCodeCamp, Odin project and instruction videos on Youtube. But
        the best help I got was from my brother. He always explained things to
        me in a simple way. He directed me mainly with various problem tasks,
        with which I consolidated the acquired knowledge.
